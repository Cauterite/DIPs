## Abstract

A *DoExpression* `do(x,y,z)` is exactly equivalent to a *CommaExpression* `(x,y,z)`, but
doesn't emit a deprecation warning.

[Deprecation of CommaExpression](https://dlang.org/deprecate.html#Using%20the%20result%20of%20a%20comma%20expression)

## Description

Using the result of a comma expression is scheduled for deprecation, so it would be
nice to have new syntax which replaces it. *DoExpression* is a new *PrimaryExpression*
which serves the purpose of *CommaExpression* with a more explicit syntax, avoiding
the problems which lead to *CommaExpression*'s deprecation.

### Rationale

- Sometimes you still need to use a comma expression. We don't live in a perfect world where every function is pure,
but we can live in a world where you don't need to split your expression into statements because of side-effects.
- The `do` keyword is currently wasted on a single rarely-used statement type ('do-while' statements).
Sure, you could implement this syntax with a variadic template function,
but why waste this opportunity to recycle `do`, when it's the perfect keyword for this purpose?
- Implementation is dead-simple (already finished).

### Breaking changes / deprecation process

None. Fully backwards-compatible.

### Examples

```d
// same expression, different syntax
assert((x, y, z) == do(x, y, z));

auto x = do(); // Error: do-expression requires at least one argument
```
